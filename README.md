### Track your grocery spend

ShopGrok automatically organises your grocery spending into categories like fresh produce & meat, household staples and cheeky impulse buys (shhh!) â€“ showing you where your money is being spent, and **helping you set a budget**.

### Save time and never forget an item

ShopGrok's **intelligent shopping list** learns which products you love and how often you buy them, and can **autofill your basket** based on your previous shopping history, or recommend cheaper options.

### Shop around without the hassle

ShopGrok determines which supermarket is cheapest and lets you switch retailers or split your shop to maximise your savings. It stores all of your weekly specials and personalised offers across all major retailers - ensuring that you **maximise your rewards**.
